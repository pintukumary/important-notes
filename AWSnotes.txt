To update cloudformation :
aws cloudformation update-stack \
  --stack-name ec2-vpc-cloudformation \
  --template-url https://rest-api-get-data.s3.amazonaws.com/template.yml \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM

Note : ec2-vpc-cloudformation - it is Cloudformation stack name
      https://rest-api-get-data.s3.amazonaws.com/template.yml - it is cloudformation template file and uploaded in s3 bucket
      CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  - it will be default

Important : if you are using lambda function with pipeline and you want to update zip file every time in lambda function and it zip will be pickup from s3 bucket then
each time zip name should be uniq to update by cloudformation otherwise with same name of zip file it con not be identify any change inside of zip file.
